# ✅ Task Management Application – SVV Project

## 📌 Overview
This is a console-based Java Task Management System developed to practice and demonstrate software testing principles. The project includes comprehensive black-box and white-box testing, 100% structural coverage using **JaCoCo** and **SonarQube**, and mutation testing to evaluate test case strength.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Add, Edit, Delete, Mark as Complete, and View Tasks
- Input validation and error handling for invalid indices
- JUnit test suite for all core functionalities
- 100% statement and branch coverage
- 10 manually introduced mutants – all successfully killed

## 🧪 Testing Highlights
- **Black-box Testing**: Based on system functionalities and boundary conditions
- **White-box Testing**: Structural coverage of all branches and conditions using JaCoCo
- **Mutation Testing**: 10 mutants created and all killed – 100% mutation score

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Java
- JUnit 5
- JaCoCo (Code Coverage)
- SonarQube (Static Analysis)
- CLI/IDE (for test execution)
